# How I ran the code
So I did in it Google Colab. To make the lab.h and lab.c I used the following lines of code
``` %%writefile lab.h ```
and 
``` %%writefile lab.c ```

so if you are runnining it in colab make sure to add these 2 lines to code in each cell of lab.h and lab.c. 
and I also used ```
